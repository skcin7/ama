# Ask Me Anything

Git repository created for the purpose of being able to ask me questions, which I will respond to.

To ask me a question, [click here](../../issues/new)!

To read all questions asked and my responses, [click here](../../issues)!

### Guidelines

* Anything means *anything*, so things like personal questions, money, work, life, code, projects, politics, religion, whatever, are all fair game. üëç
* Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
* Use a succinct title and description.
* Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
* Be civil and polite :)
