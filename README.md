# Ask Me Anything

Git repository created for the purpose of enabling a forum for asking and responding to general questions on Github. NOTE: Anything means *anything*, so personal questions, money, work, life, code, projects, politics, religion, whatever, are all fair game. üëç

To ask me a question, [click here](../../issues/new)!

To read all questions asked and my responses, [click here](../../issues)!

Feel free to clone this repository to create your own AMA. If you do, let me know so I can be the first person to ask you a question.

## Guidelines

* Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
* Use a succinct title and description.
* Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
* Be civil and polite. :) (Or don't... I'm not your mommy.)
* After I provide a thoughtful response, I'll mark your question as "Closed".
